     \ always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, \

     I finally do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, \ it is
     easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir \ or Lopunny
     pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges \ that I have to
     overcome, in the case of Garbodor and Magikarp \ especially. I have
     to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth \ sucking on my cock without
     thinking about the actual fish \ itself. It is very hard, but the
     satisfaction you get when \ you achieve victory is immense. Not
     only do you get the \ generally pleasurable feeling from
     ejaculation, but you also \ know that you overcame an obstacle few
     men have dared to try. \ I have a total of 347 successful
     ejaculations total, but it \ only gets harder as I move on. When I
     see a Serperior, for \ instance, I have to think to myself In what
     way can I imagine \ this creature in order to get off to it? It is
     a puzzle for \ sure, considering I do not have a thing for (most)
     of these \ creatures, making it extremely entertaining and
     interesting \ for others to watch. I try to focus in on its
     somewhat \ beautiful face, and think about that more than the yards
     of \ snake behind it. I sometimes have issues with Pokemon like \
     Machamp, who appear extremely male. But I always find a way. \
     There has been no hurdle too steep for me. I want to be the \ very
     best. Anything lower does not cut it. And that is why I \ am
     beating off to pictures of Lucario on the Internet, mom" () *)
