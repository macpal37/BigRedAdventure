        "I know that a lot of people want to catch em' all, but my job \
         is a much bigger challenge. It is my goal to masturbate to \
         all 807 Pokemon, plain and simple. I usually try to do it \
         twice a day, regardless of the difficulties. At the end, I \
         always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, \
         occasionally e621 in order to achieve this massive goal, and \
         when I finally do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, \
         it is easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir \
         or Lopunny pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges \
         that I have to overcome, in the case of Garbodor and Magikarp \
         especially. I have to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth \
         sucking on my cock without thinking about the actual fish \
         itself. It is very hard, but the satisfaction you get when \
         you achieve victory is immense. Not only do you get the \
         generally pleasurable feeling from ejaculation, but you also \
         know that you overcame an obstacle few men have dared to try. \
         I have a total of 347 successful ejaculations total, but it \
         only gets harder as I move on. When I see a Serperior, for \
         instance, I have to think to myself In what way can I imagine \
         this creature in order to get off to it? It is a puzzle for \
         sure, considering I do not have a thing for (most) of these \
         creatures, making it extremely entertaining and interesting \
         for others to watch. I try to focus in on its somewhat \
         beautiful face, and think about that more than the yards of \
         snake behind it. I sometimes have issues with Pokemon like \
         Machamp, who appear extremely male. But I always find a way. \
         There has been no hurdle too steep for me. I want to be the \
         very best. Anything lower does not cut it. And that is why I \
         am beating off to pictures of Lucario on the Internet, mom"
