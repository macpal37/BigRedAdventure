val add : bag -> ?count:int -> item -> unit
(** [add b ~count:c i] adds [c] copies of item [t] in bag [b]. [c] is 1
    by default. This call mutates [b]*)

val consume : bag -> ?count:int -> item -> unit
(** [consume b ~count:c i] removes [c] copies of item [t] from bag [b].
    [c] is 1 by default. This call mutates [b]. Raises [Insufficient r]
    if the number of copies [r] of item [t] is less than [c]*)
